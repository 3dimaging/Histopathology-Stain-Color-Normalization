# Histopathology-Stain-Color-Normalization
Deep Convolutional Gaussian Mixture Model for Stain-Color Normalization in Histopathological H&amp;E Images

Markup :  # Introduction #
Stain-color variation degrades the performance of the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. In the presence of severe color variarion between training set and test set in histopathological images, current CAD systems including deep learning models suffer from such an undesirable effect. Stain-color normalization is known as a remedy.
